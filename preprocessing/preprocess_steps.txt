1. Download dataset from ADNI imaging portal
2. Rearrange directories for convenient access of data

FOR MRI
3. Convert .img/.hdr files to .nii by resampling the 3D volumetric image into 256x256x256 voxels with 1x1x1mm resolution (used nibabel)
4. Extract brain from resampled image (remove eyeballs, facial characteristics, neck)
    BET - Brain Extraction Tool
5. Register image with reference to NIFT image (FLIRT algorithm on FSL)

FOR PET
6. Repeat 3-4 for PET
7. Register image with reference to corresponding registered MRI image (FLIRT algorithm on FSL)

8. Split MRI and PET image into 3x3x3 segments for feature extraction
